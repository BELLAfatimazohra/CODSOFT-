            <p style="display:none;">Matilda Winifred Muriel Graham was born on 21 April 1873 in South Kensington,
                London. She was baptized in Barnes in June of that year. The daughter of Robert Graham, a wealthy
                stockbroker, she enjoyed a privileged upbringing in Hampton-on-Thames, displaying literary and dramatic
                talent from an early age.</p>

            <h2 onclick="toggleText(this)">Achievements</h2>
            <p style="display:none;">Graham's career as an author began in the 1890s. Her short story "Through the
                Multitude of Business", published in the summer 1894 issue of Belgravia magazine, described the revenge
                of a beautiful heiress on a man who had taken advantage of her. Her first book-length novel, On the Down
                Grade, was published in 1896.

                Graham was a prolific writer, producing eighty-eight books during her lifetime, as well as several short
                stories published in newspapers and magazines. In addition to the romantic novels and thrillers which
                constituted the vast majority of her output, she also wrote a highly critical popular history of
                Mormonism, two volumes supposedly communicated by her father after his death via automatic writing, and
                a three-volume autobiography.

                Between 1908 and 1924, Graham led a campaign to ban Mormon missionaries from the United Kingdom. Her
                novel The Love Story of a Mormon (1911) was adapted into the silent film Trapped by the Mormons (1922).

                In addition to her criticisms of Mormonism, Graham also published works critical of Zionism (The
                Zionists), Christian Science (Christian Murderers), Roman Catholicism (Mary), and the women's suffrage
                movement (The Enemy of Woman).</p>
